                 from a large haploid population that evolves according to
                 random reproduction with selection and mutation. Without
                 selection, the genealogy is described by Kingman's well-known
                 coalescent process. In the selective case, the genealogy of
                 the sample is embedded in a graph with a coalescing and
                 branching structure. We describe this graph, called the
                 ancestral selection graph, and point out differences and
                 similarities with Kingman's coalescent. We present simulations
                 for a two-allele model with symmetric mutation in which one of
                 the alleles has a selective advantage over the other. We find
                 that when the allele frequencies in the population are already
                 in equilibrium, then the genealogy does not differ much from
                 the neutral case. This is supported by rigorous results.
                 Furthermore, we describe the ancestral selection graph for
                 other selective models with finitely many selection classes,
                 such as the K-allele models, infinitely-many-alleles models.

                 remains largely unexplained. A corollary is that the allelic
                 spectrum of genetic variants contributing to complex disease
                 risk is unknown. Theoretical models that relate population
                 genetic processes to the maintenance of genetic variation for
                 quantitative traits may suggest profitable avenues for future
                 experimental design. Here we use forward simulation to model a
                 genomic region evolving under a balance between recurrent
                 deleterious mutation and Gaussian stabilizing selection. We
                 consider multiple genetic and demographic models, and several
                 different methods for identifying genomic regions harboring
                 variants associated with complex disease risk. We demonstrate
                 that the model of gene action, relating genotype to phenotype,
                 has a qualitative effect on several relevant aspects of the
                 population genetic architecture of a complex trait. In
                 particular, the genetic model impacts genetic variance
                 component partitioning across the allele frequency spectrum
                 and the power of statistical tests. Models with partial
                 recessivity closely match the minor allele frequency
                 distribution of significant hits from empirical genome-wide
                 association studies without requiring homozygous effect sizes
                 to be small. We highlight a particular gene-based model of
                 incomplete recessivity that is appealing from first
                 principles. Under that model, deleterious mutations in a
                 genomic region partially fail to complement one another. This
                 model of gene-based recessivity predicts the empirically
                 observed inconsistency between twin and SNP based estimated of
                 dominance heritability. Furthermore, this model predicts
                 considerable levels of unexplained variance associated with
                 intralocus epistasis. Our results suggest a need for improved
                 statistical tools for region based genetic association and

  abstract = {In this article we discuss the ancestry of sequences sampled from the coalescent with recombination with constant population size 2N. We have studied a number of variables based on simulations of sample histories, and some analytical results are derived. Consider the leftmost nucleotide in the sequences. We show that the number of nucleotides sharing a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with the leftmost nucleotide is approximately log(1 + 4N Lr)/4Nr when two sequences are compared, where L denotes sequence length in nucleotides, and r the recombination rate between any two neighboring nucleotides per generation. For larger samples, the number of nucleotides sharing MRCA with the leftmost nucleotide decreases and becomes almost independent of 4N Lr. Further, we show that a segment of the sequences sharing a MRCA consists in mean of 3/8Nr nucleotides, when two sequences are compared, and that this decreases toward 1/4Nr nucleotides when the whole population is sampled. A measure of the correlation between the genealogies of two nucleotides on two sequences is introduced. We show analytically that even when the nucleotides are separated by a large genetic distance, but share MRCA, the genealogies will show only little correlation. This is surprising, because the time until the two nucleotides shared MRCA is reciprocal to the genetic distance. Using simulations, the mean time until all positions in the sample have found a MRCA increases logarithmically with increasing sequence length and is considerably lower than a theoretically predicted upper bound. On the basis of simulations, it turns out that important properties of the coalescent with recombinations of the whole population are reflected in the properties of a sample of low size.},

The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree.We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms.This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models.},

An approximate expression is derived for the distribution of coalescence times for a pair of sequences sampled from specific locations in a rectangular habitat. Results are qualitatively similar to previous analyses of isolation by distance, but account explicitly for the location of samples relative to the habitat boundaries. A separation-of-timescales approach takes advantage of the fact that the sampling locations affect only the recent coalescent behavior. When the population size is larger than the number of generations required for a lineage to cross the habitat range, the long-term genealogical process is reasonably well described by Kingman's coalescent with time rescaled by the effective population size. This long-term effective population size is affected by the local dispersal behavior as well as the geometry of the habitat. When the population size is smaller than the time required to cross the habitat, deep branches in the genealogy are longer than would be expected under the standard neutral coalescent, similar to the pattern expected for a panmictic population whose population size was larger in the past.

  abstract = {We study the stepping stone model on the two-dimensional torus. We
prove several new hitting time results for random walks from which we derive
some simple approximation formulas for the homozygosity in the stepping
stone model as a function of the separation of the colonies and for Wright’s
genetic distance F ST . These results confirm a result of Crow and Aoki (1984)
found by simulation: in the usual biological range of parameters F ST grows
like the log of the number of colonies. In the other direction, our formulas
show that there is significant spatial structure in parts of parameter space
where Maruyama and Nei (1971) and Slatkin and Barton (1989) have called
the stepping model “effectively panmictic.”

@article{barton2002neutral,
  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

@article{harris2016genetic,
  abstract = {Approximately 2–4\% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred
with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic
regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles.
However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that
Neanderthals had at least 40\% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal
introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-
Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5\%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on
mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the
Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious
alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other
species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.},

@article{lawrie2017accelerating,
  abstract = {Forward Wright–Fisher simulations are powerful in their ability to model complex demography and selection scenarios, but suffer from slow execution on the Central Processor Unit (CPU), thus limiting their usefulness. However, the single-locus Wright–Fisher forward algorithm is exceedingly parallelizable, with many steps that are so-called “embarrassingly parallel,” consisting of a vast number of individual computations that are all independent of each other and thus capable of being performed concurrently. The rise of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and programming languages designed to leverage the inherent parallel nature of these processors have allowed researchers to dramatically speed up many programs that have such high arithmetic intensity and intrinsic concurrency. The presented GPU Optimized Wright–Fisher simulation, or “GO Fish” for short, can be used to simulate arbitrary selection and demographic scenarios while running over 250-fold faster than its serial counterpart on the CPU. Even modest GPU hardware can achieve an impressive speedup of over two orders of magnitude. With simulations so accelerated, one can not only do quick parametric bootstrapping of previously estimated parameters, but also use simulated results to calculate the likelihoods and summary statistics of demographic and selection models against real polymorphism data, all without restricting the demographic and selection scenarios that can be modeled or requiring approximations to the single-locus forward algorithm for efficiency. Further, as many of the parallel programming techniques used in this simulation can be applied to other computationally intensive algorithms important in population genetics, GO Fish serves as an exciting template for future research into accelerating computation in evolution. GO Fish is part of the Parallel PopGen Package available at: http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/.},

  abstract = {Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.},
